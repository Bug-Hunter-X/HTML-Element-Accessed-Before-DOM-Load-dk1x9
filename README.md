This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML where an element is accessed in JavaScript before the browser has fully loaded it into the Document Object Model (DOM). The bug is that the script attempts to change the content of a div element before that element has been completely parsed and rendered by the browser.  This often results in the script failing silently, or producing unexpected outcomes. The solution shows how to fix it using an event listener.
